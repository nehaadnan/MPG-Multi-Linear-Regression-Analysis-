# MPG-Multi-Linear-Regression-Analysis-
This project involved developing a multi-linear regression model to predict the miles per gallon (mpg) of cars based on variables such as manufacturing year, number of cylinders, engine displacement, vehicle type, and fuel type. The final model achieved an impressive accuracy of 95.18%.

The analysis was conducted using R, with a focus on interpreting statistical results, checking key assumptions of regression (e.g., linearity, homoscedasticity, and multicollinearity), and refining the model for optimal performance. Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing steps ensured the reliability and robustness of the results.

The project also included the preparation of a detailed report that emphasized the importance of fuel efficiency, outlined the methodology, and presented the results in an accessible manner. Visualizations and explanations were tailored to make findings understandable for both technical and non-technical audiences.

Key skills demonstrated include statistical modeling, data analysis in R, critical evaluation of assumptions, report writing, and data visualization to communicate insights effectively.
